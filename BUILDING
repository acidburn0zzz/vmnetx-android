1. Install sqlitegen plugin into Eclipse from:
      http://code.google.com/p/sqlitegen/

   NOTE: I've been told by a user that he had to "downgrade to"
         eclipse_site_0.1.16.

2. Add bVNC from the
   bVNC/eclipse_projects/ directory to Eclipse as an existing Android
   project.

3. To build and successfully run aSPICE, you need to:
   - Install gstreamer-sdk (0.10.x, not 1.x) into /opt/gstreamer
   - cd bVNC/eclipse_projects/bVNC
   - ndk-build GSTREAMER_SDK_ROOT_ANDROID=/opt/gstreamer -j 4
   - You may have to select the "Android private libraries" entry in
       Project Properties->Java Build Path->Order and Export
     if you have it.
