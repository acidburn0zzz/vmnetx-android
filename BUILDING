1. Install sqlitegen plugin into Eclipse from:
      http://code.google.com/p/sqlitegen/

   NOTE: I've been told by a user that he had to "downgrade to"
         eclipse_site_0.1.16.

2. Add bVNC and ZoomerWithKeys from the
   bVNC/eclipse_projects/ directory to Eclipse as existing Android
   projects.

3. Ensure ZoomerWithKeys project
   is called exactly as written here by right-clicking 
   on each of them, then selecting Refactor->Rename

3. Add the ZoomerWithKeys project
   as Library References to bVNC (right-click on the bVNC project
   and select Properties -> Android -> Library).

4. Ensure that ZoomerWithKeys
   is specified as "Required projects on the build path" (right-
   click on the bVNC project, and select Properties -> Java Build
   Path -> Projects).

5. Ensure that ZoomerWithKeys
   is referenced in Properties -> Project References (put
   checkmarks on projects).

6. To build and successfully run aSPICE, you need to:
   - Install gstreamer-sdk (0.10.x, not 1.x) into /opt/gstreamer
   - cd bVNC/eclipse_projects/bVNC
   - ndk-build GSTREAMER_SDK_ROOT_ANDROID=/opt/gstreamer -j 4
   - You may have to select the "Android private libraries" entry in
       Project Properties->Java Build Path->Order and Export
     if you have it.
