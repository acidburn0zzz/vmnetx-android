1. Install sqlitegen plugin into Eclipse from:
      http://code.google.com/p/sqlitegen/

   NOTE: I've been told by a user that he had to "downgrade to"
         eclipse_site_0.1.16.

2. Clone the FreeRDP project in the parent directory of where you
   cloned bVNC project:
   git clone git://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP.git

   Check out a commit known to work with bVNC:
   git checkout stable-1.1

   You should now have bVNC and FreeRDP side by side in the same
   directory.

   Add bVNC, ZoomerWithKeys and PubkeyGenerator from the
   bVNC/eclipse_projects/ directory to Eclipse as existing Android
   projects.
  
   Add FreeRDPCore from the FreeRDP/client/Android/ directory
   to Eclipse as an Existing Android Project.

3. Ensure ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore projects
   are called exactly as written here by right-clicking 
   on each of them, then selecting Refactor->Rename

3. Add the ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore projects
   as Library References to bVNC (right-click on the bVNC project
   and select Properties -> Android -> Library). If they are not,
   add them.

4. Ensure that ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore 
   are specified as "Required projects on the build path" (right-
   click on the bVNC project, and select Properties -> Java Build
   Path -> Projects). If they are not, add them.

5. Ensure that ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore
   are referenced in Properties -> Project References (put
   checkmarks on projects).

6. To build and successfully run aSPICE, you need to:
   - Install gstreamer-sdk (0.10.x, not 1.x) into /opt/gstreamer
   - cd bVNC/eclipse_projects/bVNC
   - ndk-build GSTREAMER_SDK_ROOT_ANDROID=/opt/gstreamer -j 4
   - You may have to select the "Android private libraries" entry in
       Project Properties->Java Build Path->Order and Export
     if you have it.
